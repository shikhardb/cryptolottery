# Kickstarter Campaign using Blockchain 🎁
How nice would it be to have a Kickstarter campaign in Blockchain where the contributors have the full control over whether or not to agree to the payment to the campaign creator.

It's here now.

## Features: ⭐⭐

 - Create a New Campaign by Manager
 - Add new requests for getting contributions in ether
 - Set a minimum starting amount for the contributions
 - Contributors can see the campaigns and requests by the managers
 - Contributors can contribute in ethers to the campaigner
 - Contributors can Approve the ether/money to be sent to the campaigner after the general consensus of more than 50%
 - Manager/Campaigner can finalize the request and collect contributions if he gets the amount which is required && 50% of the campaigners agree
